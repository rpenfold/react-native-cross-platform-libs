I'm an avid supporter of true cross-platform development with significant experience in both Xamarin and React Native. Most React Native libraries are designed and built to support only iOS and Android. Because of the vast and growing popularity of React Native, I thought I'd compile a manifest of libraries that support Android, iOS, Windows, and Web.

I'm currently heavily focused on other projects right now, but I'd love to start contributing to bring many other projects to Windows and Web.
